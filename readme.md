## Description Of The Project
I've built an eCommerce app website BTH using NextJS 13 and NestJS with GraphQL. With NextJS 13, I've created a user-friendly interface and features for the users such as authentication (login, login with google, register, logout, refresh token, get profile), payment, see product details, review purchase history (update order's information or cancel order when order's status is waiting), import product and have import vouchers. Furthermore, I've created a dashboard page for admin to be able to manage the app's features such as review sales by time, DYNAMIC AUTHORIZATION (change authorization of role), CRUD features (product, order, user, feature, role, account, import order, import product, user type, brand, banner). And with NestJS, I've built a RESTFUL API with GraphQL, MongoDB, Cloudinary
